# A16-FuseBypass
This repository discloses a critical vulnerability in Apple’s A16 Bionic chip, where debug logic is executed on production-fused devices (dev-fused=0, debug=0x0). Logs show SecureROM and co-processor debug paths active without jailbreak or user tampering—violating the silicon-level trust model.
